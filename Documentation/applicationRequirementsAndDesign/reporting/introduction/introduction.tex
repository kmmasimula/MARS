The reporting module is responsible for displaying and exporting reports. Two types of report units are available:
\begin{description}
\item[Survey unit]:  A summary of survey responses to a specific question over a team or a round.  
\item[Attribute unit]:  A summary of user attributes over a team or a round.  
 \end{description}
A report consists of one or more report units.  The reporting unit uses services provided by the import/export module (Section \ref{importExport}) to export reports in different formats.
