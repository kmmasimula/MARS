The user module is responsible for maintaining demographic information about the users, some of which may be team managers. Users can be assigned to teams (see the teams module in Section~\ref{teams}) and  given access to surveys (see the survey module in Section~\ref{survey}). Users have profiles containing personal detail as well as attributes which can be updated using import facilities (see the import and export module in Section~\ref{importExport}) as well as analysis tools (see the analysis module in Section~\ref{analysis})
