Each user has the following detail associated with his account
\begin{itemize}

\item User name - used as userId
\item Password
\item Title
\item Initials
\item First name
\item Surname
\item Cell number
\item Email address
\end{itemize}

A user is one of two kinds
\begin{itemize}
\item  Admin - indicated with 'A' in the status field.
\item User - indicated with 'U' in the status field.
\end{itemize}

Each user can have multiple associations with teams (See the teams module in Section~\ref{teams}).  

For team allocation purposes, users may be associated with multiple attributes which can be updated using import facilities (see the import and export module in Section~\ref{importExport}) as well as analysis tools (see the analysis module in Section~\ref{analysis})
