To calculate the personality diversity of a team, first calculated a relative ratio for each of the four dimensions in the team by using the formula below :

$f(K_i)$ = 1 - (Max (Right, Left, Neutral) / (Right + Left + Neutral))

where 
\begin{description}
\item[Right =] number of members with the right side preference (for example in EI dimension it will be the number of I)
\item[Left =] number of members with the left side preference
\item[Neutral =] number of members with either no preference or equal number of preferences from reviewers and
\item $i$ in $f(K_i)$ is the number of the dimension.
\end{description}

An overall team diversity score is calculated using the following formula:

$Team\ diversity = \sum\limits_{i=1}^4 f(K_i)$
