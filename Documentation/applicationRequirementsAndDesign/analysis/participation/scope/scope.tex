Participatory styles are determined by the responses of some peers of the user to three types of questions included in surveys. These are the ranking question (see Section~\ref{rankingQuestion}), the hour estimation question  (see Section~\ref{hourQuestion}) and the the quality rating question  (see Section~\ref{qualityQuestion}). 

The participatory analysis module consists of sub-modules. The scope for each of these sub-modules are described in the sections that follows.  The sub-models respectively provides the functionality to analyse survey responses to
\begin{itemize}
\item determine participatory styles of users based on responses to the ranking question (Section \ref{rank}).
\item determine participatory styles of users based on responses to the hour estimation or the quality rating question (Section \ref{rate}).
\item determine participatory styles of users by combining the participatory styles resulting from two or more other participatory style analyses (Section \ref{participatoryStyle}).
\item determine a team cohesion value based on the participatory styles of the members in the team (Section \ref{cohesion}).
\end{itemize}
