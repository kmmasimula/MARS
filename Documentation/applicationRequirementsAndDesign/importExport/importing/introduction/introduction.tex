\begin{description}
\item[Validation stage]

The user specifies the csv file that should be uploaded. The specified csv file is parsed and verified. The process stops at the first failure and produces an error message showing the detail of the problem. If the entire file passes the detail of the data that is ready for import is displayed.

\item[Import stage]
The system provides a interactive menu to persist the displayed data.
